		<p class="aboutmee"><span>About Me!</span><br/>Hello my friends! Welcome to my page! My name is Ka Kin Ng and feel free to call me Andy. I am currently a senior in college. Currently my major is 3D animation. My focus used to be Computer Enginnering, but due to the difficult of the course and unable to keep up in the courses, I gave up on it. Because of that I am going to be in school for at least 3 more years. Out of all the majors I could have pick after quitting engineering, I choose something within DMD because I have always enjoyed art and before becoming a engineer, I have always wanted to do graphic design. Since University of Connecticut doesn't offer that, I thought DMD would be the closest thing out there that can be related to graphic design. </p>
		
		

		<p>One of my top 3 favorite things to do is playing games. I like any type of game, it can be video games, outdoor games, outdoor sports, or even table top games. I am one of those type of people that only likes to play with friends. I usually would get bored if I play with randoms or no one at all.</p>

		<p>One of my other favorite top 3 things to do is watching anime and reading manga. Some people maybe think it is childish and for kids but it is kind of my escape from reality. So it is kind of important to me. My favorite types of anime/manga are usually romance comedy.</p>

		<p>Lastly, I love listening to musics. I pretty much like anything, but the things I listen to most is post-hardcore, kpop, jrock, and alternative rock. When I tell people that I listen to Kpop or Jrock, the first thing they always ask me is "Do you know what they are saying?". I have no idea what they are saying but it just sounds really good to me. I usually would look up translations for the music.</p>
