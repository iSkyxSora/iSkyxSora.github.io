			<h3 class="sub-titles">About Me</h3>
		
		<div class="paragraphs">

			<p class="descriptions">
			Hello my friends! Welcome to my page! My name is Ka Kin Ng, and I am a senior at the University of Connecticut. I am currently working towards my B.A in Animation, with a focus in 3D Animation. I have always enjoy art and animation. I have always wonder to myself on how people make these cool and flashy animations, so it would be cool if I could do that one day.</p>
		
			<p class="descriptions">One of my top 3 favorite things to do is playing games. I like any type of game, it can be video games, outdoor games, outdoor sports, or even table top games. I am one of those type of people that only likes to play with friends. I usually would get bored if I play with randoms or no one at all.</p>
		
			<p class="descriptions">One of my other favorite things to do is watching anime and reading manga. Some people maybe think it is childish and for kids but it is kind of my escape from reality. So it is kind of important to me. My favorite types of anime/manga are usually romance comedy.</p>

			<p class="descriptions">Lastly, I love listening to musics. I pretty much like anything, but the things I listen to most is post-hardcore, kpop, jrock, and alternative rock. When I tell people that I listen to Kpop or Jrock, the first thing they always ask me is "Do you know what they are saying?". I have no idea what they are saying but it just sounds really good to me. I usually would look up translations for the music.</p>

			<h3 class="sub-titles">My First PC Build</h3>

				This was my frist PC I have ever build. The tower, video card, and the power supply were old parts from my friend. As you can see, I actually repainted the tower white. The reason why I did that was because it would match my motherboard better and I thought it looks much nicer when it is white. LOL!

				Working this tower was a huge pain. One because the case's design were old, so it is much harder to build on it compare to the newer towers nowadays. Two, we forgot to remove some screws inside the tower before spraying, so the screw for the motherboard took forever to get on because of the paint. somehow everything manage to workout. The powersupply was also modular, which is why it looks extremely messy in the tower. I tried my best to clean up the wires and I think I did a fairly decent job. I don't know if you can tell, but I actually used a piece of cardboard to hold up my SSD (very getto), in those image, but I recently did get a SSD holder.

				Wa-la! This is my set up! I think overall it took me like 5 hours to finish building and setting up my desktop because I had to keep running to work to help my parents at the restaurant and coming back home when it wasn't busy anymore.
