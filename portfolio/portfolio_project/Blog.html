			<h3 class="title-aboutme">About Me</h3>
		
			<p class="aboutmee">
			Hello my friends! Welcome to my page! My name is Ka Kin Ng, and I am a senior at the University of Connecticut. I am currently working towards my B.A in Animation, with a focus in 3D Animation. I have always enjoy art and animation. I have always wonder to myself on how people make these cool and flashy animations, so it would be cool if I could do that one day.</p>
		
			<p class="aboutmee">One of my top 3 favorite things to do is playing games. I like any type of game, it can be video games, outdoor games, outdoor sports, or even table top games. I am one of those type of people that only likes to play with friends. I usually would get bored if I play with randoms or no one at all.</p>
		
			<p class="aboutmee">One of my other favorite things to do is watching anime and reading manga. Some people maybe think it is childish and for kids but it is kind of my escape from reality. So it is kind of important to me. My favorite types of anime/manga are usually romance comedy.</p>

			<p class="aboutmee">Lastly, I love listening to musics. I pretty much like anything, but the things I listen to most is post-hardcore, kpop, jrock, and alternative rock. When I tell people that I listen to Kpop or Jrock, the first thing they always ask me is "Do you know what they are saying?". I have no idea what they are saying but it just sounds really good to me. I usually would look up translations for the music.</p>
